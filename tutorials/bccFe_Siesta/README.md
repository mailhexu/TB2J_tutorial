### Example on how to run TB2J with Siesta collinear spin calculation.

The Siesta input files are in the DFT_files directory.
- Fe.fdf : input parameters
- Fe.psf : pseudopotential file.

If you just want to try the Siesta interface, the Siesta output file for the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices is already there (siesta.nc).
Run the command in the get_J.sh to get the exchange parameters.

The reference TB2J output file is in the TB2J_results directory.
