### Example of running TB2J with Collinear spin Wannier functions.
The structure is an SrMnO3 cubic perovskite structure. The DFT calculation is done with the ferromagnetic spin configuration.The Fermi energy is 6.15 eV.

The Wannier90 output files can be found in the wannier_files directory. 
The TB2J command can be found in the get_J.sh file, run it to get the TB2J_results.
