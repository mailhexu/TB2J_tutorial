### Example: How to run TB2J with spinor Wannier functions to get isotropic/anisotropic exchange and DMI.

To get the anisotropic exchange and DMI, three non-collinear spin calculations with structures rotated from z to x, y, and z axis are needed. 

The results are in the Wannier_files directory, there are x, y, and z directories. The Wannier90 output files are already prepared. 
Run the command in get_J.sh to get the TB2J results. And in the DFT directory, run the command in  merge.sh to get the merged results. 

The reference resutls are in the TB2J_results directory.
